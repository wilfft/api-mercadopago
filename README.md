### Learning how to integrate MercadoPago API

```
npm init
npm install express mercadopago nodemon
```

> dependencies
>
> "express": "^4.17.1",
>
> "mercadopago": "^1.5.1",
>
> "nodemon": "^2.0.6"

##### Manual product payment is working, but to receive MercadoPago response we need deploy the app, because MercadoPago needs a path to return payments status
